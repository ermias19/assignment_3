            Published in January 2015, my first book helps guide students <br> through the process of studying more productivity and boosting <br> their grades – while simultaneously cutting down on their study <br> time. <br>
            
            A short, punchy read, it combines my personal experience as both <br> a student and entrepreneur with data-backed scientific <br> evidence. Digital editions are also available for free at College Info <br> Geek. <br></p>

    <td width=50%><p>

        For 2020, I launched a brand-new course all about how to build strong habits. <br><br><br>
        Success in your long-term goals requires regular, incremental progress over a long period of time. In other words, it requires strong habits! <br><br><br>
        
        This course will help you to narrow down your goals (especially helpful if you have a lot), break the ones you’re focusing on down into actionable habits, and stick to those habits by combining self-discipline with smart external tools and systems. <br><br>

            In January 2019, I launched my first full-fledged course –<strong> Productivity Essentials: Create a Custom System That Works.</strong><br><br> 
            
            It’s a complete guide to creating a productivity system – the <br> combination of a task manager, calendar, file & folder <br> organization method (both digital and physical), note-taking <br> system, and more. <br> <br>
            
            The point of the course: <strong> Never let anything slip through the cracks.</strong> Once you’ve gone through the <br> course and set up your <br> system, you’ll always be on top of everything in your life. <br><br>
